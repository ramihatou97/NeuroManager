Medishift: Neurosurgery Resident Scheduling & Education PlatformMedishift is a comprehensive, AI-powered application designed to manage the complex scheduling, organization, and educational requirements of a neurosurgery residency program. It is built on a foundation of customizable rules, seamless module integration, and intelligent, data-driven analysis to ensure fairness, safety, and efficiency.Core FeaturesHierarchical AI Scheduling: A multi-layered system that generates and optimizes Yearly, Monthly, and Weekly schedules based on a sophisticated, fully customizable rules engine stored in Firestore.Predictive Vacation & Leave Management: A two-layered leave system featuring a proactive Planner (Holiday/Exam Manager) and a reactive Handler (Individual Request Analyzer) that uses historical data to project coverage risk and ensure fairness.Integrated Educational Tracking (EPAs): An Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) module that automatically identifies learning opportunities from the OR schedule and assigns them to residents in real-time.Intelligent Data Extraction: A standalone Python microservice that can parse various document formats (PDF, Excel, Word) to extract and integrate existing schedules, reducing manual data entry.Reactive Conflict Auditing: An automated nightly audit system that detects and flags conflicts between approved vacations and newly published schedules, creating resolution tickets for administrators.Project StructureThis project is a monorepo containing three main parts:/frontend: A React application built with TypeScript that serves as the user interface./backend/functions: A set of serverless TypeScript functions for Firebase that handle the core business logic./shared: Contains the unified TypeScript data model (types.ts) used by both the frontend and backend to ensure data consistency.Getting StartedPrerequisitesNode.js (v16+)Firebase CLI (npm install -g firebase-tools)A Firebase project set up with Firestore.Installation & SetupClone the repository:git clone <your-repo-url>
